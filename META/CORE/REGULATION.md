# Development Principles
Core principles guiding development decisions.

1. Atomic File Structure
Principle: Each file should have a single, well-defined purpose.

A file that defines a server should only define the server. A file that contains utility functions should only contain those functions. Avoid creating monolithic files that handle multiple, unrelated responsibilities.

Why: Separation of concerns makes code easier to locate, understand, modify, and test.

2. Atomic Code (Functions/Classes)
Principle: Every function or class should do one thing and do it well.

Functions should be small and focused. If a function is performing multiple distinct operations, it should be broken down into smaller, more specific functions.

Why: Small, focused functions promote reusability and simplify testing and debugging. Code becomes self-documenting through clear, descriptive function names.

3. Always Test
Principle: Always implement comprehensive, reasonable, and well-defined test cases before moving too far on any component/feature development.

Use tests flexibly during development to verify coding ideas and logic. Tests should not be overwhelming; tests should not interfere with development; tests should be helping the development.

Why: Early testing catches issues sooner, validates logic incrementally, and prevents technical debt. Tests serve as living documentation of intended behavior.

4. Co-located Documentation
Principle: Any significant feature, module, or service within a package must be accompanied by a ***_META.md file in the same directory, where *** is the component/feature name.

This file should explain the feature's purpose, its core logic, and how it interacts with other parts of the system.

Example: A complex GraphGenerator service must be located alongside a GraphGenerator_META.md file that explains its algorithm and usage.

Why: Complex components need context. Co-located documentation ensures future developers understand the "why" behind implementation decisions and how pieces fit together.

5. Proper File Structure
Principle: Files serving different functionality at different levels of the service should be organized into folders or sub-folders with names that concisely explain their content.

Working with the Co-located Documentation principle, each folder should have one and only one META.md that describes all of its content (scripts, sub-folders)
Properly use sub-folders to organize code
Understand file structure as a tree: any non-leaf node should not have too many files, or no files at all if logically there should be no file at that abstract level
Why: Clear hierarchical organization makes the codebase navigable and understandable. Balanced tree structure prevents both flat chaos and over-nesting.

6. Comments and Code Style
Principle: Adapt Google Style in specific code writing. Comments should be good so that another developer would be able to pick up development of the project.

Guidelines:

Explain WHY, not WHAT (code should be self-explanatory for what it does)
Document complex algorithms or non-obvious logic
Link to relevant META files for deeper context
Use JSDoc for public APIs
Don't leave commented-out code (use git history instead)
Why: Consistent style improves readability across the codebase. Good comments explain reasoning and context that isn't apparent from code alone.

7. Iteration Awareness
Principle: We code in iterations. Therefore, it is extremely important to be aware of cleaning up old-version code if the older versions are no longer in use.

Avoid redundancy at your best.

Guidelines:

Remove unused imports, functions, and files after refactoring
Don't keep "just in case" code; use version control instead
When deprecating: mark with JSDoc, log warnings, document replacement, then remove after one iteration
Before refactoring: ensure tests exist
After refactoring: remove old code and update documentation
Why: Code accumulates cruft over time. Regular cleanup prevents confusion, reduces maintenance burden, and keeps the codebase lean and understandable.
